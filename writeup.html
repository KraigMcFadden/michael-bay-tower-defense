        I computed the change in velocity (<code>dvdt</code>) by adding together the forces (gravity, attractors,
        damping) and then I updated the velocity by multipying by <code>delta_t</code>.

<p><hr><p><a name='Sphere+source'></a><h2>Sphere source</h2><p><hr><p>
        I sampled from the surface of the unit sphere by sampling in the unit cube, rejecting points outside the sphere,
        and then normalizing to the surface of the sphere. This is the position. I set the velocity to be proportional
        to the position, plus the base velocity.

<p><hr><p><a name='Animated+mesh'></a><h2>Animated mesh</h2><p><hr><p>
        I sampled uniformly among the faces of the mesh, then sampled uniformly inside each triangular face
        (based on section 4.2 of http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~funk/tog02.pdf). I initialized the velocities to the
        base velocity plus a random vector with length 5.0.

<p><hr><p><a name='Damping'></a><h2>Damping</h2><p><hr><p>
        I added to the velocity change <code>dvdt</code> terms proportional to the velocity and velocity squared,
        with proportionality constants given by the x and y components of the dampenings vector.

<p><hr><p><a name='Uniform+distribution'></a><h2>Uniform distribution</h2><p><hr><p>
        I changed the face sampling of the animated mesh so that the probability of choosing a face is proportional
        to its area. I first computed the areas of all the faces, made a cumulative mass function, then sampled
        uniformly from 0 to the total area, and used the CMF to choose the face. The rest of the position initialization
        is the same.

<p><hr><p><a name='Ground+plane'></a><h2>Ground plane</h2><p><hr><p>
        To detect collisions, I took the dot product between the plane normal vector and the position and compared it
        to the offset of the plane from the origin. For the sink, I simply used <code>killParticle</code> to kill
        the particle. For the bounce plane, I decomposed the velocity into normal and tangential velocities and
        reversed the normal velocity, multiplying by some damping factor. Then, I ensured that the position was above
        the plane (plus epsilon) so that re-collision would not be detected on the next step.

<p><hr><p><a name='Sphere+collision'></a><h2>Sphere collision</h2><p><hr><p>
        To detect collisions, I compared the distance from the center to the position with the radius. Then, similar
        to with planes, I used <code>killParticle</code> for the sink and reversed the normal velocity with the
        damping factor for the bounce sphere. Finally, I ensured that the position was outside the radius (plus
        epsilon) so that collisions to avoid re-collision.

<p><hr><p><a name='Spring+system'></a><h2>Spring system</h2><p><hr><p>
        First, I implemented a function to compute the force due to a spring in <code>calcHooke</code>. This implements
        a Hooke force modulated by a damping force based on the relative velocity. Then, I computed <code>dvdt</code>
        as before with gravity, attractors, and Hooke forces between neighbors using <code>calcHooke</code>, and used
        that to update velocities.

        I implemented a bird flocking simulation based on the active particle model analyzed in this biophysics paper
        by Bialek et al. (2012): http://www.pnas.org/content/109/13/4786. Instead of updating velocities based on
        force calculations, this model updates velocities directly and requires all velocities to be the same in
        magnitude.

        <p>There are three contributions to the velocity: (1) a distance-independent tendency to tend toward the
        mean of neighboring birds (the number of neighbors, <code>FlockUpdater.n_neighbors</code>, can be set on
        creation), (2) a distance-dependent contribution that pushes neighboring birds closer together but does not
        permit them to become closer than a minimum distance, and (3) a stochastic random component.

        <p>This produces flocking behavior with high pairwise correlations for larger values of <code>n_neighbors</code>
        but these long-distance correlations are destroyed when <code>n_neighbors</code> is smaller (e.g.
        <code>n_neighbors = 1</code>). It is interesting to re-run the simulation with differing values of this
        parameter, and observe the critical point / transition point dynamics in the tendency of the birds to flock.

        I multiplied both the color alpha channel and the size of the particle by some factor on each step such that
        the alpha and size decayed exponentially with some timescale (ideally independent of <code>delta_t</code>).

<p><hr><p><a name='Art'></a><h2>Art</h2><p><hr><p>
        I made the birds change color based on how close the neighbors are (i.e how "happy" they are). Based on the
        average distance between neighbors being considered, the color of each bird interpolates between red (far,
        because they're "unhappy") and yellow (near, because they're "happier"). This makes the birds look a little bit
        like fireflies in the way that they swarm together and are each differently colored.
